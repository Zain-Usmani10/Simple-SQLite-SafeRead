Here are the compile instructions:
1. Compile the SQLite library. This should create a file called sqlite3.o which is what C++ will use:
    gcc -c sqlite3.c -o sqlite3.o

2. Compile the writer. You should see writer.exe:
    g++ writer.cpp sqlite3.o -o writer.exe

3. Compile the reader. You should see reader.exe:
    g++ reader.cpp sqlite3.o -o reader.exe

4.  Now we create the data.db by running writer.exe:
    ./writer.exe

NOTE: At this point you will also see data.db-wal -> WAL is short for (Write Ahead Logging), which
is used to write into the data.db. First the data enters the WAL file and then gets safely added to 
data.db through the middle file, data.db-shm, which is also called the "Shared Memory File"

5.  Once writer.exe has been running for a bit and data has accumulated, we can create snapshot.db by running reader.exe:
    ./reader.exe

NOTE: To run reader.exe, you have to split terminal and use a new terminal for the ./reader.exe command.
This is because the previous terminal is busy constantly writing to data.db in an finite loop.

You should now see copy.db which can now be exported via USB stick. Make sure to enter Ctrl+C to the writer terminal
to make it stop logging data infinetly.

EDIT: WAL mode has been removed to minimize number of files
